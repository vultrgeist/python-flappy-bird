# Retro Flappy Bird Game

A simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   clone this repo
   cd python-flappy-bird
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Create the assets

To create the assets (in the \assets folder), simply run:
```
python create_assets.py
```

## Running the Game

To start the game, simply run:
```
python flappy_bird.py
```

Use the spacebar to make the bird flap and avoid the pipes!

## Assets

The game uses simple placeholder images for the bird, pipes, and background. You can replace these with your own images by placing them in the `assets` directory with the following filenames:
- `bird.png`
- `pipe.png`
- `background.png`
